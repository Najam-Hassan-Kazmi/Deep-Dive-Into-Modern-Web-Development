<h1>Course Information</h1>
This assignment is a fairly basic project to practice the creation and use of React library to perform different tasks. We have got a course information panel here and we have practiced different ways to pass props to the components and functions.<br>
I have added comments to make this very much easier to understand for you in this one as well.
<br><br>
This one was pretty easy because of it being a basic level coding concepts. But that was worth learning. After getting to know about this method, I believe passing data to other functions is pretty harder in other languages.

In case you are having issues in understanding the working of this assigment project, I will be waiting for your message.ðŸ˜‰
