<h1>Anecdotes</h1>
This project is a general daily tips panel. Where we can see as much amazing quotes about programming and upvote the ones we like the most.<br>
I have added as many comments to make this very much easier to understand for you.
<br><br>
It was interesting to watch my best quotes and upvote them while I was testing the project. Adding the logic was pretty easy until there were too many states that I had to initialize. But that was worth it. Look, who does not love his code working?😁

In case you are having issues in understanding the working of this assigment project, I will be waiting for your message.😉
