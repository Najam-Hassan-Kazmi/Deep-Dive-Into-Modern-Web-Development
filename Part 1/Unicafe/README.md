<h1>Course Information</h1>
This is a straightforward feedback taking system and performing some calculations over them which, in this case are basic but we can perform other useful operations based on the information/feedback we are recieveing. This one had a more complex use of the states of the web page. This took me a bit of time at the start but gradually got the grip of the concept. It did not bother me after that.ðŸ˜‰<br>
Solved questions do give you a good vibe and peace, no?ðŸ˜ƒ
<br><br>
This contained a bit f detail that is important about states for us to learn so that we can create single page applications.<br><br>
In case you are having issues in understanding the working of this assigment project, I will be waiting for your message.ðŸ˜‰
