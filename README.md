# Deep-Dive-Into-Modern-Web-Development
This is the ULTIMATE Full Stack Development Course. This is an open course that you can do NOW! Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

This course is worth 14 credits and the final project is worth 10 credits. Which makes it 24 credits in total.

I will be creating a new file for each part of the course and the particular explanation of those assignments will be shared inside the folders individually.

Let's start our journey and hope for the best of fun exercises and memories!
